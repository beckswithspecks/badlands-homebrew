The lizardfolk there are divided into two camps, the wisdom seeking Blacktooth and the Titan worshiping, cannibalistic Kotharluath, or Kothar. Their civil war is almost 10 years old and no one could easily say who is winning. Due to the dangerous nature of the swamp and the challenge of finding resources the civil war will frequently die down to a low simmer for seasons as both sides recuperate.",

                    "The Blacktooth are tribal and have small communities throughout the swamp. Their capital, Guhadha'xa, is a large town in size. It is the hub for the spiritual elders of the community and for trade. Before the war, the lizardfolk worked hard to protect their lands, keep their young safe and make a home for themselves. They revered the nine, but mostly Busana and Liisa. They tried to fight their natural inclination towards fear, aggression and pleasure. Many of them would find outlets in swimming competitions, wrestling and other physical activities that would burn off the passions of the body. A lizardfolk who seeks enlightenment likely has a great internal struggle between their lizard brain and their will to be something more.",

                    "After the war, the lizardfolk's struggle for enlightenment became far more difficult. The psychic toll of knowing a great threat existed in the swamp waiting to eat them was immeasurable. The relatively regular fighting led them towards their more base tendencies. This war is not about territory only, but also about the spirits of the people."

Their communities are divided between the wealthy merchants, some of which are slavers, and the indigenous desert tribes that try to be one with nature. The desert is a brutal master and the dark elves that survive are a tough people. When the infection came to their lands it engulfed the massive tent cities. The dark elves fled into the desert where the hot sun protected them. Many more infected died of starvation and exposure than to the weapons of the dark elves. The dark elves believe that each has a song within them. Learning that song and singing it out loud is the truest expression of the self. This inner song grows and changes with the shape of the life of the elf. The high elven ways run opposite to the dark elves. This tension has led to more than one mocking ballad, midnight duel or minor battle. The great tragedy Romero and Juliana tells the tail of a high elf and dark elf and forbidden love."

Once dragons became hard to find they turned their eyes towards the Yuan Ti people, a introspective snake people. The wars were one sided, and the Yuan Ti had to flee their lands. The dragonborn control their borders fiercely and the infection never made it into their lands. Their young travel as part of their coming of age rituals. Additionally, a dragonborn considers the moment of death to be the defining event in meeting destiny. As such the death penalty is non existent, serious criminals are exiled."

Just recently it was discovered that the magic was not keeping the monstrosities out but instead absorbing them like a sponge and keeping them in suspended animation. Over time the magic could not contain and control the 100s of monstrosities trapped within. It started to faulter and occasionally spit them out. Adventurers from New Hope investigated and discovered the root of the magic. A choice had to be made, collapse the pocket back into Morra or forever sever the connection. They chose to have the firbolgs rejoin the Badlands to struggle for survival.",

Over the next three years there were a record number of beheadings at the kings very own hands, including 3 Jarls from Maladvan that tested him. The queen did not die due to powerful magic. She sought out the destroyer helm and created the demon infection. She was insane with a desire for revenge and the horde of infected spread far beyond Alt Walav.",
